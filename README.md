# Pre-processing

This branch includes Collab notebooks which can be used to test pre-processing of data before it is used for a classifier.

## **Contents:**

1. Comparison of LDA and PCA: 

    This notebook allows the user to upload a .csv file of data where the accuracy results of the data can be compared to when LDA and PCA are used. The classifier is an SVM but can be changed to the desired classifier if required. The user assigns a set number of K-folds and for each fold, the accuracy is displayed and when the number of components is 1 the data points are shown graphically. The confusion matrix of each fold is combined and once all folds are complete the overall accuracy of the total confusion matrix is displayed.
